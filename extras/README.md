# Rode Wireless Mic GoPro Mount Sleeve

![Two small rectangular yellow boxes sit next to each other on a table.  There are holes in the top of them so rectangular wireless microphone modules can slide in, and a slot to allow the clips from the modules to hold them in place.  A cut-out on one box shows the receiver module screen displaying the audio level; and the transmitter module has a 3.5mm audio jack plugged in through another hole in the box](3D-printed-sleeves.jpg)
